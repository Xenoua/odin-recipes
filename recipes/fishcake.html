        <h2>Steps on how to make Stir-fried fishcake:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and turn the heat off. Plunge the fish cake for 30 seconds. Drain and cool. This step removes excess oil and softens the fish cake, but you can skip it if you want.</li>
            <li>Cut the fish cake into bite size pieces. Thinly slice the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick pan with 2 tablespoons of oil over medium high heat. Add the garlic, onion, and scallions, and cook for a minute. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the fish cake and chili peppers, and stir-fry for about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce ingredients over the fish cake and vegetables. Stir well, and cook until the sauce is well distributed and absorbed and the fish cake and vegetables are tender, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
        </ol>
